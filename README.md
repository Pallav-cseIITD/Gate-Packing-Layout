# Gate-Packing-Layout
**Gate Packing Layout Optimization**

**Introduction**  
This project focuses on solving the Gate Packing problem, where the objective is to arrange rectangular logic gates in a compact layout. The goal is to minimize the bounding box area that encloses all gates, ensuring there are no overlaps between gates.

**Problem Statement**  
You are given:

-   A set of rectangular logic gates (g1, g2, ..., gn) with specified dimensions (width and height).
-   A bounding box that contains all gates.

**Objective**: Assign positions to all gates such that:

1.  No two gates overlap.
2.  The bounding box area is minimized.

**Constraints**:

-   Gates cannot be rotated or re-oriented.
-   Connections between gates are ignored.

**Input and Output Specifications**

*Input*:  
Each line specifies a gate and its dimensions in the format:  
\<name of gate\> \<width\> \<height\>

Example:

g1 3 10

g2 8 3

g3 6 6

*Output*:

1.  Bounding box dimensions:  
    bounding_box \<width\> \<height\>
2.  Gate positions:  
    \<name of gate\> \<x-coordinate\> \<y-coordinate\>

Example:

bounding_box 11 10

g1 0 0

g2 3 7

g3 3 1

**Solution Approach**

1.  **Initial Placement**
    -   Use a greedy algorithm to place gates sequentially.
    -   Ensure no overlapping and attempt to minimize the bounding box dimensions during placement.
2.  **Bounding Box Calculation**
    -   Compute the smallest rectangle that encloses all gates.
    -   Update dimensions dynamically as gates are placed.
3.  **Optimization**
    -   Apply heuristic adjustments to refine the initial layout, aiming to further reduce the bounding box area.
4.  **Output Generation**
    -   Write the bounding box dimensions and gate positions in the specified format.

**Visualization**

A Python script (visualize_gates.py) is provided to visualize the gate layout.

**Prerequisites**:  
Install required Python packages:

pip3 install tk pillow

**Usage**:  
Run the script with the following command:

python3 visualize_gates.py output.txt input.txt \<rows\> \<columns\>

Example:

python3 visualize_gates.py output.txt input.txt 50 50

**Features**:

-   Randomly colored gates displayed on a grid.
-   Gates labeled with their names for easy identification.

**Testing**

**Constraints**:

-   Number of gates: 0\<n≤10000 \< n \\leq 1000
-   Gate dimensions: 0\<width, height≤1000 \< \\text{width, height} \\leq 100

**Steps**:

-   Use the provided sample input files for initial testing.
-   Generate additional test cases to validate edge conditions and ensure correctness.

**Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates an efficient solution to the Gate Packing problem. By minimizing the bounding box area, the layout becomes compact, which is crucial for optimizing physical space and enhancing circuit design performance.
